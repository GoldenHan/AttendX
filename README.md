# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## How to Deploy Your Application

Your application is hosted on Firebase App Hosting, which uses a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline linked to your Git repository.

To publish your latest changes to your live URL for your users to see, follow these steps:

1.  **Commit Your Changes:** Make sure all your recent changes are saved and committed using Git.
2.  **Push to Your Git Repository:** Push your commits to the main branch of your linked Git repository.
3.  **Automatic Deployment:** Firebase App Hosting will automatically detect the push and start a new build and deployment process.
4.  **Check the Firebase Console:** You can monitor the progress of your deployment in the Firebase console under the App Hosting section.

Once the deployment is complete, your live URL will be updated with the latest version of your app.
